The summer after my first year of college, I had the opportunity to intern at KCCI Channel 8 News, the Des Moines CBS-affiliate.

From storm chasing to breaking news, I got to experience the newsgathering process firsthand by shadowing reporters and producers at the station. A thunderstorm hit and I watched as the reporter I was with went live from inside a truck repair shop where we were rained in. I spoke with disaster victims after severe rain caused flooding throughout the Des Moines metro area. KCCI covered the disappearance of Mollie Tibbetts, and we were there day in and day out through the investigation until the discovery of her body. Every story I went on taught me something new about being a reporter.

I created my own versions of the stories we covered. The internship allowed me to practice writing to video, editing using Adobe Premiere and voicing my stories. Here are some examples of the work I produced:
