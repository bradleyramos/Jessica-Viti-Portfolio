For Medill, we have to complete an internship for credit through a program called Journalism Residency in order to graduate. I completed my JR at WKOW 27 News, the ABC-affiliate in Madison, Wisconsin. By week 3, I already began turning packages for the weekend news, and by week 5, I was turning packages for the 5 pm shows. From writing web stories to VOs and VOSOTs to putting together packages, Iâ€™ve worked my way up in just a short amount of time.
