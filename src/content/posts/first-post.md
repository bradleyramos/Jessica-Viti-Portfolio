I have been a part of Northwestern’s student-run news network since my freshman year. This organization gives me the opportunity to practice reporting techniques and newsgathering. Being able to shoot, write and edit my own stories has allowed me to foster my broadcast skills, both in front of and behind the camera. I contribute to both our general newscast, Northwestern News Report, and our sports show, Sports Night. Here is some of my work:

Here, I give an update from Welsh-Ryan Arena on the NCAA tournaments amidst the COVID-19 outbreak. Update: eventually, the NCAA canceled the tournaments along with the entire season of spring sports.

Anchoring Sports Night’s January 30, 2020 show in which we pay homage to Kobe Bryant alongside the rest of the sports world.

My first time anchoring for Sports Night. What I like about our sports broadcast is that it doesn’t take itself too seriously.

This is NNN’s first ever attempt at a live shot. I was lucky to get the chance to try it out. We experienced some difficulties setting up the equipment, and I was told to use a script unlike what most reporters do in the field. Despite the cold weather and technical difficulties, I appreciated the studio providing students with another opportunity to practice an important reporting technique.

This is one of the first videos I ever edited. It was really fun to cover this event because it was a huge story at the time, but I’ve learned a lot since this experience.
