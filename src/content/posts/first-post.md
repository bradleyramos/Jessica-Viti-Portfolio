I have been a part of Northwestern’s student-run news network since my freshman year. This organization gives me the opportunity to practice live shots, on-air work, behind-the-camera work and newsgathering. Being able to shoot, write and edit my own stories has allowed me to foster my broadcast skills, both in front of and behind the camera. I contribute to both our general newscast, Northwestern News Report, and our sports show, Sports Night. Here is some of my work:

[![Northwestern News Network - 11/13/18](/assets/nnn-11-13-18.png "(0:57-1:53) -  This is NNN’s first ever attempt at a live shot. I was lucky to get the chance to try it out. We experienced some difficulties setting up the equipment, and I was told to use a script unlike what most reporters do in the field. Despite the cold weather and technical difficulties, I appreciated the studio providing students with another opportunity to practice an important reporting technique.")](https://youtu.be/1dElJyATdSk 'Northwestern News Network - 11/13/18')
