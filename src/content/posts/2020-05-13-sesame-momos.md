During Summer 2019, I began freelance writing for Pure Hoops Media, a platform dedicated to covering basketball, both on and off the court and in various forms.

The first article I wrote was inspired by the U.S. Women’s National Team during the Women’s World Cup. Seeing the effect they had on the public by speaking out while playing in major tournament made me curious about how women are dealing with gender inequality in different sports, so I zeroed in on the WNBA.
