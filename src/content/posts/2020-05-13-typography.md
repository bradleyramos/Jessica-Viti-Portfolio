HAVANA, Cuba– Over spring break, I was lucky enough to travel to and report in Havana, Cuba with Medill. Learning about media production and consumption in a communist country was a valuable opportunity. In addition, being able to experience international reporting at such an early stage in my career was very challenging yet exciting. It forced me to use my Spanish skills. Luckily, I also had access to a translator who facilitated the interview process, as well as the logging process.

I found inspiration in the Cubans’ love of sports, specifically boxing, for one of my stories. Someone at my homestay, the house I lived in while I was visiting, put me in touch with a Cuban boxing trainer, Evelio Padron. I took videos while I was there, but my interviewees did not want to appear on camera, so I adapted it into a photo story. I also only had an hour to collect my interviews and photos. Besides these challenges, along with the language barrier, I came out of the story with gritty photos that are symbolic of the toughness of boxing and Cubans alike.

The other story I did was more of a travel-blog piece. This is becoming a very popular style nowadays. We found tourists and Havana natives to give us the scoop on Old Havana, or Habana Vieja from their unique perspectives.
