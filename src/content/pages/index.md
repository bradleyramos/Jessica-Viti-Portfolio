Hi, my name is Jess! I'm a recent graduate from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University, where I studied journalism (with a focus in broadcast), political science and integrated marketing communications. My expansive skill set and global experience will lend itself well to a fast­-paced newsroom that values diverse perspectives and a commitment to dynamic storytelling.
