Hi, my name is Jessica! I recently graduated from Northwestern University, where I studied journalism, political science and integrated marketing communications. My expansive skill set and global experience will lend itself well to a fast-Â­paced newsroom that values diverse perspectives and a commitment to dynamic storytelling.
