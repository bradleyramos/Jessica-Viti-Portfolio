---
My path to graduation started in 2014 when I moved from New Jersey to Iowa. I had lived on the east coast my whole life, so moving to the midwest was a bit of a culture shock. Had I not moved to Iowa, though, I may never have discovered the city of Chicago and a nearby school called Northwestern University.

I've always loved being near a big city, which is what drew me to Northwestern. My passion for reading and writing naturally brought me to the Medill School of Journalism, Media and Integrated Marketing Communications. During my time here, I realized my love for broadcast journalism. The highlight of my college career was getting the opportunity to report internationally in Cuba. I'm sad that my Medill journey is ending, but I'm looking forward to a new adventure. Feel free to contact me about my experience!
