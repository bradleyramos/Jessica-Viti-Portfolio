Hi there!

My name is Jessica Viti, and I’m a multi-platform producer at 13WMAZ in Macon, Georgia. Right now, I produce the station’s 6/11 p.m. newscasts, but over the last year and seven months, I’ve tried my hand at nearly every show we produce. 
My journey at WMAZ began on the Weekend Morning shift. The hour-long Saturday and two-hour-long Sunday shows taught me how to become fast,resourceful and creative as a producer. I worked with a seasoned anchor who pushed me to become a stronger writer for broadcast news. 

Eventually, I moved onto the Weekend Evening shift, where I had to navigate becoming a leader in the newsroom. Without a manager or a veteran anchor to help guide my decision-making, my own news judgment was really put to the test. I also had to juggle managing the other members of the weekend team. For example, I sought out more training from our digital content manager so I could become a better resource for our weekend digital team member. On this shift, we often had abbreviated shows due to CBS sports coverage, which presented another learning curve for me. I worked closely with production during those shows to make sure I was fitting in the most essential news and weather updates of the day in a shortened amount of time. 

In April of this year, I started full time as the producer of the station’s 6/11 p.m. newscasts. I enjoy both shows for different reasons. While I can’t be as creative with the content I select for the 6, I can be creative in the way I present those stories. I really try to push my showcasing abilities when I do the 6. The goal of our 11 p.m. newscast is to catch people up on the biggest stories of the day and take a deeper dive into those stories. This show tests my ability to build content, whether it’s working with my nightside reporters on set-up and breakout opportunities, or finding national or Verify stories that I can connect to our Central Georgia audience.
