Hi there!

My name is Jessica Viti, and I’m a multi-platform producer at 13WMAZ in Macon, Georgia. Right now, I produce the station’s 6/11 p.m. newscasts, but I’ve tried my hand at nearly every show we produce.

My journey at WMAZ began on the Weekend Morning shift. The hour-long Saturday and two-hour-long Sunday shows taught me how to become fast, resourceful and creative as a producer. I worked with a seasoned anchor who pushed me to become a stronger writer for broadcast news.

Eventually, I moved onto the Weekend Evening shift, where I had to navigate becoming a leader in the newsroom. Without a manager or a veteran anchor to help guide my decision-making, my own news judgment was really put to the test. I also had to juggle managing the other members of the weekend team. For example, I sought out more training from our digital content manager so I could become a better resource for our weekend digital team member. On this shift, we often had abbreviated shows due to CBS sports coverage, which presented another learning curve for me. I worked closely with production during those shows to make sure I could fit the most essential news and weather updates of the day in an abbreviated amount of time.

In April of this year, I started full time as the producer of the station’s 6/11 p.m. newscasts. I enjoy both shows for different reasons. The 6 p.m. gives me the space to be creative in the way I present my reporter’s stories. I really try to push my showcasing abilities when I do the 6. The goal of our 11 p.m. newscast is to catch people up on the biggest stories of the day and take a deeper dive into those stories. This show tests my ability to build content, whether it’s working with my nightside reporters on set-up and breakout opportunities, or finding national or Verify stories that I can connect to our Central Georgia audience.

Now, I am looking to continue my journey as a broadcast news producer in a market and a station where I can keep growing. The work environment where I tend to thrive is one where I constantly receive feedback and where collaboration is encouraged. I am adaptable and open to working different shifts to see where I fit in best. I love the nightside life, but would be open to trying anything because that’s what helped me grow into the producer I am now.

Aside from producing, here’s what else you need to know: I grew up in New Jersey, but moved to Iowa when I was in high school. After that, I graduated from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University– go Wildcats! I love spending time with my family, especially my sister’s two lovable corgis. My favorite pastimes include going to concerts, watching the Indianapolis Colts on Sundays (or Thursdays or Mondays) and trying new restaurants in new cities.
